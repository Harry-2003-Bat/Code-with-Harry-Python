**type of module** - 1) _Built-in-Module_ - already install in python languge 
<br>
2) _External Module_ - written by expert and you can use it during code 
<br>
Example - a) requests for making HTTP requests
<br>
b) numpy for numerical computations
<br>
c) pandas for data manipulation and analysis
<br>

**\n** - use for shift the Text to next line 
<br>
**#**-  Comments in pyton ( we can also use ''' & --- respectively )
<br>
**\** - Escape sequence character use to jump the text to next line

print("Hello World" , 6, 7, sep="-", end="009\n") you can also seprate this by using **sep** parameter 
<br>

**Data Types**: Python has several built-in data types, including:
<br>
**Integers (int):** whole numbers, e.g. 1, 2, 3, etc.
<br>
**Floats (float):** decimal numbers, e.g. 3.14, -0.5, etc.
<br>
**Strings (str):** sequences of characters, e.g. "hello", 'hello', etc.
<br>
**Boolean (bool):** true or false values
<br>
**Lists (list):** ordered collections of items, e.g. [1, 2, 3], ["a", "b", "c"], etc.
<br>
**Tuples (tuple):** ordered, immutable collections of items, e.g. (1, 2, 3), ("a", "b", "c"), etc.

**Create a Simple Calculator**

import math
take = input("Enter the first number: ")
take2 = input("Enter the second number: ")
add = int(take) + int(take2)
sub = int(take) - int(take2)
mul = int(take) * int(take2)
div = int(take) / int(take2)
math.fmod  = int(take) % int(take2)
print("The Superman of the two numbers is: ", add)
print("The Batman of the two numbers is: ", sub)  
print("The Wonder Women of the two numbers is: ", mul)
print("The Flash of the two numbers is: ", div) 
print("the Cyborg of the two number is: ", math.fmod)
